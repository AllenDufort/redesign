        <h1>Problems with Old Design</h1>
        <p>
            Going on Heng's home page, I typically have trouble trying to figure out how to use the website.
            In order to improve the website, I wrote down all the issues that I found with the website, including usability and accessability.
        </p>

        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <p>Usability is basically how easy it is for some to use an interface, like a website. 
            For Heng's website, I noticed a few usability issues in terms of efficiency, learnability, and memorability.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Learnability:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The function of the 3 circles on the right side is unclear</li>
                <li>At first glance, it unclear where to click to order</li>
                <li>There is no clear indication of where the user should click to navigate the website</li>
            </ul>
            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Memorability:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard to remember where order button is</li>
                <li>Hard to remember what tabs are under "More..."</li>
            </ul>
            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Efficiency:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The user must scroll down to see the menu and the name of the restaurant</li>
                <li>The user must scroll all the way down to find restaurant address</li>
            </ul> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            Accessibility is how easy it is for people with disabilities to use a website. 
            Using WebAIM analysis tools, I found a few accessibility issues with the website.
            One issue found was that the text in the navigation bar were too small.
            Another issue found was that the contrast between the text and the background was too low in the navigation bar,
            main website body, and button text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I agree with the WebAIM analysis on the website's accessibility. 
            However, there are 2 other points of inaccessibility that I found that WebAIM didn't mention:
            <ul>
                <li>The 3 circles on the right-hand side have low contrast with the black background</li>
                <li>The navigation bar and main body text are too small on mobile</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
